 * Script made for the Advanced Topics in Web Development (UFCEWT-20-3) at the
 * University of the West of England in the years 2013-2014. This is part B1 course
 * component, dealing with part "2.1.1" and "2.1.2".
 * 
 * 2.1.1
 * The script accesses the database file "crimes.xml" located at
 * http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~~g2-petzall/atwd/crimes/doc/
 * and return XML and Json crime totals of all regions.
 * 
 * 2.1.2
 * The script also shows specific regions from the same source as 2.1.1, returning
 * the data as XML and Json.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Initial ideas inspired by Michael Parkin:
