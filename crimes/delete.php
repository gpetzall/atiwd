 * Script made for the Advanced Topics in Web Development (UFCEWT-20-3) at the
 * University of the West of England in the years 2013-2014. This is part B1 course
 * component, dealing with part "2.2.3".
 * 
 * The script deletes an area (most commonly the prescribed "wessex" one) specified
 * by HTTP $_GET in the "crimes.xml" file located at
 * http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~g2-petzall/atwd/crimes/doc/ and display what has been
 * deleted as well as the new england and england_wales calculated totals.
 * 
 * In addition to the assignment specification, this script can delete any area and
 * can also be specified to one particular region (like if there are duplicates).
 *
 * If there is more than one specified area, and the region is not specified, the
 * first area that matches the specification is deleted.
 * 
 * To restore any changes, reset the "crimes.xml" using the "reset.php" script in
 * this folder.
